# Email--Puller-Pro

**This is for our 85 subscriber milestone, and lets try to get to 100 by the end of the month!**

Hello guys, this is my email puller! This script works well with the device puller; another script i made and released earlier, you can find them in my profile page! This script will ask for an email, and when entered, it scans it for all info it can find. It can find info from the ISP (Internet Service Provider) all the way to its IP Address. 

This code is not to be messed with as it can do damage to people. Please only run this script on emails you own, or have explicit permission to do this scan on. I cannot be held legally for your illegal actions.

# Setup:

**First, install libraries:**

`pip install ipinfo`

All the other imports are built in libraries, so dont worry about those, just run this command first.

# Run Program:

**Enter this command to start the script. Please add the `sudo` at the beggining as you may need admin perms to access certain info when fetching from the API.**

`sudo python3 main.py`

**Enter your desired email that you have explicit permissions for**

After you do those steps, you should have a nice formatted result, with the info you will want.
